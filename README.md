# greener-grass

Greener-grass is a website that allows customers to schedudle lawn care services based on the weather for that day and whether or not that day is a holiday

## functionality

While on the website, the client can fill out a form with their name, email, and phone number. Then they select a date with the date picker provided and the service of choice. To assist clients with their day of choice, a five day weather forecast is also provided. IF the day they pick is either a holiday or a rainy day, they will need to pick another day
